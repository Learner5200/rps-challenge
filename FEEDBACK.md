(This is feedback on my own work, as I was not assigned a pair...)

# Feedback

## README

* Could have used screenshots?

## Folder Structure

* Fine

## Tests


* Could be more thorough: e.g. scorekeeper tests should cover all outcomes

## Design

* Maybe could have used a computer class - not sure it's that important though
* Maybe could have made multiple simpler views, isntead of using fat controllers/conditionals to re-use same ones?

## Conventions and good practices

* Rubocop mostly passes: could have shortened that line
